# Troubleshooting Guide

If you're experiencing issues with your custom Discord theme, here are some common problems and their solutions. Follow these steps to resolve any issues and ensure the theme works as expected.

## 1. **Theme Not Showing Up**
   - **Cause**: The theme may not have been properly applied.
   - **Solution**: 
     1. Ensure that you've followed all the installation steps correctly.
     2. Check that the theme file is properly linked in your Discord settings.
     3. Try restarting Discord to make sure the changes take effect.

## 2. **Colors or Layout Appear Incorrect**
   - **Cause**: The theme might be conflicting with other extensions or custom settings.
   - **Solution**: 
     1. Clear your browser cache or Discord app cache (this can help reset any old settings).
     2. Check if any other themes or extensions are interfering with the display. Disable any other themes and see if the problem persists.
     3. Make sure the theme is up-to-date by checking the repository for new releases.

## 3. **Theme Looks Odd or Doesn’t Fit Properly**
   - **Cause**: Your Discord window size or resolution might be causing the theme to break.
   - **Solution**:
     1. Try adjusting your screen resolution or Discord window size to see if the theme adjusts accordingly.
     2. If you’ve made any personal modifications to the theme’s CSS, double-check the code for errors.

## 4. **My Window is not transparent**
   - **Cause**: Transparency is not enabled.
   - **Solution**:
     1. Go to settings and make sure that `Window Transparency` is enabled.
     2. Fully restart Discord
     3. If it is still not working, you may have to configure your compositor to allow transparent windows (Linux only).

## 5. **Other Elements of Discord Aren't Displaying Correctly**
   - **Cause**: Certain Discord UI elements may not be compatible with the theme.
   - **Solution**:
     1. Ensure that Discord is updated to the latest version.
     2. Review the theme’s code for any specific elements that may need adjustments for compatibility.
     3. If necessary, contact support or the theme developer for more specialized assistance.

## 6. **Unable to Install the Theme**
   - **Cause**: The installation may not have been completed properly.
   - **Solution**:
     1. Follow the installation guide again, making sure you don’t miss any steps.
     2. Double-check that you have all the necessary permissions or tools to install the theme (e.g.Vencord, BetterDiscord, Powercord).
     3. If you're still having trouble, refer to the FAQ or reach out for support in the repository's Issues section.
